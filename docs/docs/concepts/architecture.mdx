# Architecture

LangChain as a framework consists of a number of packages.

## langchain-core

This package contains base abstractions of different components and ways to compose them together.
The interfaces for core components like LLMs, vector stores, retrievers and more are defined here.
No third party integrations are defined here.
The dependencies are kept purposefully very lightweight.

## langchain

The main `langchain` package contains chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
These are NOT third party integrations.
All chains, agents, and retrieval strategies here are NOT specific to any one integration, but rather generic across all integrations.

## langchain-community

This package contains third party integrations that are maintained by the LangChain community.
Key partner packages are separated out (see below).
This contains all integrations for various components (LLMs, vector stores, retrievers).
All dependencies in this package are optional to keep the package as lightweight as possible.

## Partner packages

While the long tail of integrations is in `langchain-community`, we split popular integrations into their own packages (e.g. `langchain-openai`, `langchain-anthropic`, etc). This was done in order to improve support for these important integrations.

For more information see:

* A list [LangChain integrations](/docs/integrations/providers/)
* The [LangChain API Reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/) where you can find detailed information about the API reference of each partner package.

## LangGraph

`langgraph` is an extension of `langchain` aimed at building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.

LangGraph exposes high level interfaces for creating common types of agents, as well as a low-level API for composing custom flows.

## LangServe

A package to deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs. Makes it easy to get a production ready API up and running.

:::important
LangServe is designed to primarily deploy simple Runnables and work with well-known primitives in langchain-core.

If you need a deployment option for LangGraph, you should instead be looking at LangGraph Cloud (beta) which will be better suited for deploying LangGraph applications.

## LangSmith

A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.
